## Creative Component

### Additional Piece of Information
For this part of the creative component, I decided to get the site name of the website. If websites have many pages within them, the title would be different from the parent website name so I thought it would be interesting to include that in the preview.

A url with this information is [https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics).

### Styling/Visual Change
I added margins to many of the html elements so they were not condensed together. Before, the input bar and button were touching the resulting div. This was unpleasant to look at so I added margins to the div so it was spaced out from the inputs. I also added margins within the div with the paragraph and img elements so the inside of the box was less condensed as well. I think this is an improvement because it makes the information easier to read and differentiate.
